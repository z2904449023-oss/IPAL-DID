# Coding Samples – IPAL-DID 
Author: Xinyi Zhou

## **Overview**

This project evaluates the causal impact of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) on provincial trade flows in China using annual panel data and modern difference-in-differences methods. The analysis follows **Borusyak, Jaravel & Spiess (2021)** and supplements the main DID-imputation estimates with:

* **Temporal placebo tests**
* **Spatial placebo tests**
* **Randomization inference with 100 simulations** for both placebo types
* **Distributional inference for tau₀** (the contemporaneous treatment effect)

The code is written in Stata and is fully reproducible.

## **Dataset**

The dataset is stored at:

```
/Users/zhouxinyi/Desktop/PKU/term paper/Data for Student Term Paper/Panel Data(China Provincial)2.dta
```

### **Key variables**

| Variable                    | Description                                   |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `prvn`                      | Province ID                                   |
| `year`                      | Observation year                              |
| `trade`, `export`, `import` | Trade variables                               |
| `bri_year`                  | The first year a province implemented the BRI |
| `rel_year`                  | Event time: `year – bri_year`                 |
| `lntrade`                   | Log of total trade                            |

Observations with missing trade data and those prior to 1988 are removed.

## **Code Structure**

### **1. Data inspection & missing-value handling**

The script:

* Summarizes variables
* Checks for missing data
* Removes observations missing `trade`, `export`, or `import`
* Verifies panel structure (`xtset prvn year`)
* Checks for gaps in yearly sequences
* Restricts dataset to years ≥ 1988

This ensures clean and balanced panel data for DID estimation.

---

### **2. Constructing treatment timing and event time**

The script assigns `bri_year` based on the adoption year of the BRI in each province.
Event time is defined as:

```
rel_year = year – bri_year
```

`lntrade = ln(trade)` is used as the main outcome.

---

### **3. Descriptive trends (pre-model visualization)**

To visually compare treated vs. untreated provinces:

* Provinces are grouped by BRI implementation year
* Yearly mean trade values are collapsed
* A multi-cohort trend plot is generated

This provides an intuitive check on trend similarity prior to treatment.

---

### **4. Main estimation: DID-Imputation (Borusyak et al., 2021)**

The core method uses:

```stata
did_imputation lntrade prvn year bri_year, pre(10) horizons(0/8) ///
    cluster(prvn) autos delta(1) minn(5)
```

Features:

* 10 pre-treatment leads
* 0–8 post-treatment horizons
* Province-clustered standard errors
* Automatic selection of untreated comparisons

An event-study plot is generated using `event_plot`.

---

### **5. Temporal Placebo Tests**

#### **(a) Single temporal placebo**

Treatment year is shifted **5 years earlier**:

```
bri_year_T_Placebo = bri_year – 5
```

This tests whether spurious effects appear **before** true policy implementation.

---

#### **(b) 100 temporal placebo simulations (random treatment shifts)**

To implement **randomization inference (RI)**:

* Random shifts of ±1 to ±5 years are applied to treated provinces
* `did_imputation` is run 100 times
* Each simulation extracts the placebo estimate of `tau0`
* These placebo τ₀ values form a **null distribution**

The script then:

* Computes a **two-sided RI p-value**:

  ```
  p = (# of |tau_placebo| ≥ |tau_real|) / (R + 1)
  ```
* Plots a histogram of simulated τ₀ values
* Marks the **real τ₀ estimate** with a red line

This is a rigorous falsification test.

---

### **6. Spatial Placebo Tests**

#### **(a) Single spatial placebo**

Provinces are randomly assigned into artificial treatment cohorts:

* 2015 group
* 2016 group
* 2017 group
* 2018 group

The distribution of random assignments approximates real treatment proportions.

---

#### **(b) 100 spatial placebo simulations**

Each simulation:

* Randomly assigns provinces to pseudo-treatment groups
* Runs `did_imputation`
* Extracts τ₀

A second RI p-value is computed, and a histogram is plotted.

This tests whether results could be driven by **geographical clustering or compositional differences**, rather than the BRI itself.

---

## **Outputs**

The script produces the following:

### **Event-Study Figures**

1. **Main DID-imputation event-study**
2. **Temporal placebo event-study**
3. **Spatial placebo event-study**

### **Randomization Inference Figures**

4. **Histogram of 100 temporal placebo τ₀ values**
5. **Histogram of 100 spatial placebo τ₀ values**

Both figures include a red reference line representing the **true** τ₀ estimate.

---

## **Reproducibility**

To reproduce the results:

1. Install required Stata packages:

```stata
ssc install did_imputation
ssc install event_plot, replace
```

2. Update the dataset path if needed
3. Run the do-file from top to bottom

The code uses fixed random seeds (`set seed 2024`), ensuring full replicability.
